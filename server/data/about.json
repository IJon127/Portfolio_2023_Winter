  "intro": [
    "I am a creative technologist and architect originating from Taiwan and currently based in New York. My academic journey has been diverse, culminating in a master's degree in Interactive Telecommunications from New York University, another master's degree in Creative Arts and Mental Health from Queen Mary University of London, and a bachelor's degree in Architecture from Tunghai University.",
    "My expertise lies in merging everyday observations and natural phenomena to craft interactive art pieces. These encompass a wide array of creations, including interactive installations, generative art, games, and websites. Over three years, I've actively contributed to the field, particularly as an artist and exhibition designer. My portfolio proudly boasts extensive large-scale installations and media projects featured at various festivals, theaters, and prestigious museums both in New York and Taiwan."
